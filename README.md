## Toggle hiding all windows upon idle

Hide windows after idle for 10 minutes, intended for usage with wallpaper engine backgrounds, but will work with other screensavers.
Move mouse to bring windows back.

### Python3 Script Usage:
```bat
py toggle_desktop.py
```
OR

```bat
python toggle_desktop.py
```



### TODO:

- [ ] Hide desktop icons when minimizing
- [ ] Remember how desktop icons were set before minimizing (no point bringing them back if the user had them hidden before)
