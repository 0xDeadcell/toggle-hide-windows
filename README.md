## Toggle hiding all windows upon idle

*Hide windows after idle for 10 minutes, intended for us with wallpaper engine backgrounds, but will work with other screensavers.*

*Move mouse to bring windows back.*

### Python3 Script Usage:
```bat
py toggle_desktop.py
```
OR

```bat
python toggle_desktop.py
```





- [ ] Hide desktop icons when minimizing
- [ ] Remember how desktop icons were set before minimizing (no point bringing them back if the user had them hidden before)
