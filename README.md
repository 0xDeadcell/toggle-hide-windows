## Toggle hiding all windows upon idle

*Hide windows after idle for 10 minutes, intended for us with wallpaper engine backgrounds, but will work with other screensavers.*

*Move mouse to bring windows back.*



- [ ] Hide desktop icons when minimizing
- [ ] Remember how desktop icons were set before minimizing (no point bringing them back if the user had them hidden before)
